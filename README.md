# iOS7 parallax homescreen

An HTML5, CSS3 and JS implementation of the iOS7 parallax homescreen using [Twitter Flight](https://github.com/twitter/flight) and [flight-orientation](https://github.com/cameronhunter/flight-orientation).

The background image moves as you tilt and rotate your device.

[Give the demo a try on your smartphone](http://cameronhunter.github.io/flight-orientation-app). Currently it's only been tested on Chrome for Android on a Galaxy Nexus.
